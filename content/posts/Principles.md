## Volition

I believe that **all success stems from self-belief**. I have intense self-belief, balanced with intense self-awareness. This fuels my strong determination to bring forth my mission into the world. 

I believe that people have an **enormous capacity to make things happen**. Human potential is essentially infinite. I expect great things from myself and the people around me.

I am **deliberate** in the things I do. I prioritize my tasks for effectiveness, and every action I take has reasoning behind it. Not making a decision is a decision.

## Iterative Development

I **make systems work for me**. A repeatable process codified and executed violently at scale is my biggest leverage - in my life, in my product, and in my company. 

I believe in abundance: when everybody gets their fair share of the pot, the pot grows bigger for everybody. I **actively create win-win situations** for myself and others..

I **optimize for learning**. I am a curious creature, and am constantly learning. I treat life as a constant experiment, and dig deep into the nature of reality to uncover principles for myself. I keep note of what works, what doesn't and learn from mistakes.

I **love feedback**. I consider all forms of information - emotional or otherwise - to be feedback which informs the actions I take. Every outcome is a lesson. The Obstacle is the Way.

I am Agile. **Speed of implementation and rapid iteration** is key for me to achieve product-market fit and gain market share.

I'm always on lookout for **high-leverage activities and individuals**. Compounding returns is the only real magic in this world.

## Character

I **respect my time**. I try to make the most of my time and take care to not waste someone else's time.

I value the **power of a good question**. I consider questions as tools of discovery that reveal valuable insights and do not shy away from asking the tough questions.

I believe **all success is earned**. Luck has to be actively created by putting yourself in that position to recieve it.

I am a creator, and **give away more value than I consume**. I create enormous value for society, and get rich from a fraction of the value I create.

I describe myself as **happy, well-rounded person**. I obsess about mission, health, community, environment and relationships
